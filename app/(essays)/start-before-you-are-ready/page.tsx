      <p className="mt-5">I never feel quite ready before doing something.</p>

      <p>
        {" "}
        It might be anything from: launching a product writing a newsletter
        (like this one) starting a Youtube channel calling my grandma And this
        list might go on forever. Right now I’m stuck at recording a demo video
        for my new product. I’ve done all the heavy lifting already (product,
        landing, docs, support, payments) and this step is literally what’s
        blocking me from moving on with marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what annoys me the most is that I can’t make myself do this. I keep
        making mental excuses that I’m not good enough to make this video, my
        English accent isn’t that perfect, and that it just makes no sense.
        Wrong. It makes perfect sense. This is a roadblock I must get through in
        order to progress and become mentally stronger and more resilient. Every
        journey has one, so here’s mine.
      </p>

      <p>
        A couple of days ago I had a walk with my friend. We usually buy some
        sausages and marshmallows, then make a tiny fire in nature and roast
        them. It’s delicious, lemme tell you.
      </p>

      <p>
        So as we sat enjoying the fire, he asked me about the project I’d been
        working on for months. I was kinda stuck and couldn’t find words to say
        because it was embarrassing for me to acknowledge that I’d been actually
        procrastinating on it for quite some time. So I explained to him my
        “issue”, so to speak, with this damn demo video that kept me moveless.
        And what he said was: “Maybe you should allocate the whole day for it,
        like next Tuesday”
      </p>

      <p>
        It sounded so simple and straightforward. I became motivated the second
        he said it. I immediately took out my phone and created a new reminder
        on Tuesday to record it. Suddenly, I remembered a quote about taking a
        responsibility for something you struggle to do (thanks to Tim Ferriss),
        so I suggested to my friend that we should come up with a punishment for
        me in case I fail to get it done by Tuesday. We agreed on me sending him
        $20 if I fail. Not much, but it'll definitely keep me accountable now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Honestly, it felt so liberating. Today is Monday, and I’m writing a
        script for this demo video. Tomorrow I’m spending the whole morning
        recording it.{" "}
        <i>
          (update from the future: I recorded the video and next week made my
          first ever sale)
        </i>
      </p>

      <p>So if you’re in a similar situation like me:</p>

      <ol className="list-decimal">
        <li>call up your friend</li>
        <li>tell about your struggle</li>
        <li>name a deadline</li>
        <li>suggest a payment in case you fail</li>
        <li>finally do your thing with much less stress</li>
      </ol>
    </article>
  );
